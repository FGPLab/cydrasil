## **About Cydrasil**

Cydrasil is a comprehensive, curated, and community-built cyanobacterial reference package containing over 1300 16S rRNA gene
sequences with lengths exceeding 1100 base pairs. Cydrasil offers a curated alignment and a maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree that can be used for sequence placement or <i>de novo</i> phylogenetic reconstructions.
Cydrasil utilizes phylogenetic placement to give you a complete phylogenetic perspective of your new isolate or amplicon survey.

## **Methodology**
Cydrasil was created originally as a comprehensive cyanobacterial 16S rRNA gene reference package to be used with phylogenetic placement algorithms like <a href="https://matsen.fhcrc.org/pplacer/" target="_blank">pplacer</a>, 
<a href="https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/epa/index.html" target="_blank">RAxML epa</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng" target="_blank">EPA-ng</a>. When we originally populated the database,
we had strict inclusion criteria for reference sequences.
<br>
<ol>
    <li>The sequence must come from an isolated strain or a single-cell genome. Exceptions were made for metagenome-assembled
    genomes on a case by case basis after manual review of the genome (needed for most sibling clade sequences).</li>
    <li>Each reference sequence must be 1100 base pairs or longer. The minimum length was chosen as a compromise between
    strain coverage and sequence information for phylogenetic reconstruction. Of note, this excludes all
    cyanobacteria sequenced using the <a href="https://aem.asm.org/content/63/8/3327.long" target="_blank">NÃ¼bel et al. 1997</a>
    cyanobacteria-specific primers.</li>
</ol>

Cydrasil is populated with sequences collected from NCBI, JGI-IMG/M, and user submissions.
The reference alignment was generated using [SSU-Align](http://eddylab.org/software/ssu-align/)<sup>1</sup> with default parameters. This aligner uses a profile-based alignment strategy, in which each target sequence is aligned independently to a covariance model that uses the 16S rRNA gene secondary structure, and then masked using SSUMASK with the automatically computed alignment confidence values (posterior probabilities). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was then generated using the [RAxML-HPC2](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/)<sup>2</sup> Workflow on XSEDE (8.2.12) on the [CIPRES Science Gateway](http://www.phylo.org/)<sup>3</sup>. The ML + thorough bootstrap workflow was used with the following modified parameters: 1000 bootstraps (-N 1000) and the GTRGAMMA model. All other parameters were left at default values.

## **How to Conduct a Local Sequence Placement Run**

1. ### **Alignment of query sequences to Cydrasil reference alignment**

    A FASTA file containing sequences of interest (typically Cyanobacterial sequences extracted from the reference sequences file output from Qiime 1/2) is aligned to the reference alignment. 

    Here you can use either **PaPaRa<sup>4</sup>** or **SSU-Align<sup>1</sup>** to align your query sequences to the Cydrasil reference alignment. The reference package contains a phylip (.phy) alignment (Cydrasil reference alignment) to use with PaPaRa.  

    >#### **Using  PaPaRa**

    >| -s   | Reference alignment in phylip (.phy) format                                                | cydrasil-v3-reference-alignment.phy |

    >#### **Using SSU-Align**  
    >[SSU-Align Information](http://eddylab.org/software/ssu-align/)
    >
    >##### **SSU-Align Use**  
    >SSU-Align uses a workflow instead of just one command, but has the advantage of using the same alignment model as the Cydrasil reference alignment.  
    >**Importantly**, SSU-Align uses input order instead of input flags (-t) for parameters.  
    >The command ```ssu-align``` will align your query sequences to the SSU-Align 16S model.  
    >```
    >ssu-align query-seqs.fasta output-directory-name
    >```
    >##### **Example ```ssu-align``` Workflow**
    >```
    >ssu-align query-seqs.fasta aln
    >```
    >Mask the alignment using the mask file in the Cydrasil reference package
    >```
    >ssu-mask -s alignment.bacteria.mask aln/
    >```
    >Reformat the SSU-Align alignment from stockholm (.stk) to aligned fasta (.afa)
    >```
    >ssu-esl-reformat -o aligned-query-sequences-masked.afa afa aln/aln.bacteria.mask.stk
    >```
    >>Alternatively, the command ```ssu-prep -x``` allows for a multi-threaded alignment run on a desktop computer, but requires a few extra steps.  
    >>This is recommended for large query sequence files.  
    >>```
    >>ssu-prep -x query-seqs.fasta output-directory-name number-of-threads
    >>```
    >>
    >>#### **Example ```ssu-prep``` Workflow**
    >>```
    >>ssu-prep -x query-seqs.fasta aln 1
    >>```
    >>Output is a bash script: aln<!--This is a comment to prevent Markdown autolinking-->.ssu-align.sh  
    >>Running the script will execute the SSU-Align alignment
    >>```
    >>bash aln.ssu-align.sh
    >>```
    >>Cleanup the bash script

2. ### **Conduct a sequence placement run using [EPA-ng](https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng)**
    Next, we use the aligned query sequences as the input into a sequence placement algorithm. We recommend [EPA-ng](https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng).

    #### **EPA-ng Arguments**
    | Flag    | Description                                     | Filename                                                             |
    |---------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | -s      | Cydrasil reference alignment file in afa format | cydrasil-v3-reference-alignment.afa                                  |
    | -t      | Reference tree file                             | cydrasil-v3-reference-tree.nwk                                       |
    | -q      | Query sequence alignment                        | SSU-Align: aligned-query-sequences-masked.afa \| PaPaRa: query.fasta |
    | --model | Cydrasil model parameter specification file     | cydrasil-v3.bestModel                                                |
    | -w      | Output directory                                |                                                                      |
    | -T      | Number of threads for multithreading            |                                                                      |
    >**IMPORTANT NOTE**
    >If you used PaPaRa to align your query sequences, you need to run an extra command before you do placements to remove the reference sequences from the query alignment.
    >***This is a product of how PaPaRa was coded. If you skip this step, your output file will contain both query and reference sequences as placements.***
    >```
    >epa-ng --split cydrasil-v3-reference-alignment.phy papara_alignment.combined-aln
    >```
    >The output file from this command is ```query.fasta```  

    **Example EPA-ng Command**
    ```
    epa-ng -s cydrasil-v3-reference-alignment.afa -t cydrasil-v3-reference-tree.nwk -q aligned-query-sequences-masked.afa --model 
    ```
    **Output**

    EPA-ng outputs a .JPLACE file named ```placements.jplace```.

3. ### **Visualize and analyze your results**

    **Tree Visualization**

    To visualize the .JPLACE containing the sequences of interest, the placement file ```placements.jplace is uploaded onto [iTOL] (https://itol.embl.de/)<sup>5</sup>. Placements act as a dataset within iTOL and can be toggled. Nodes with sequences of interest are visualized with red circles and clicking a node will show a breakdown of sequence ids and the corresponding confidence values for that node. 

    Steps to visualize tree in iTOL:

    1. Create an user account with iTOL

    2. Upload (drag and drop) .jplace file into an iTOL project

    3. Reroot the tree by searching for **WOR1** and then clicking on its parent node (**I2504**) and navigating to **Tree structure > Re-root the tree here**

    4. From the Controls box set parameters as follows:

    >Basic
    >- Display mode: Normal
    >- Parameters: 0 degree rotation
    >- Invert: No
    >- Slanted: No
    >- Branch lengths: Use
    >- Labels: At tips **NOTE:** You can toggle labels to off if the tree slows your computer.
    >- Label rotation: On
    >- Label alignment: Left

    >ADVANCED: No changes. If you are having trouble reading your results, you can use the scaling factors to separate leaves.

    >DATASETS
    >- Turn on phylogenetic placements 
    >- Use âShow query formâ to search placement of individiual query sequences
    >- Insert query sequence ID and and click on the sequence ID name to display red circles indicating phylogenic placement of a given query sequence.
